This algorithm conjugates the Ojibwe (Southwest dialect) verbs.

## Grammar

    Independent: An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought, thus it can stand alone as a sentence.

    Dependent: A dependent clause, also known as a subordinate clause, is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.

### Verb Inanimate Intransitive (VII): "Something is verbing."
    1. Verb is subject and does not take an object 
    2. Verb is always third person singular ("it")

    Independent:
        a. Positive: It is raining.
        b. Negative: It is not raining.

    Dependent:
        a. Dependent Positive: The run shines *when it is not raining*.
        b. Dependent Negative: The sun does not shine *when it is raining*.


    VII Orthography Rules:
        1. Verbs drop final letter "d" in independent negative, dependent positive, dependent negative


Code Refactor Goals: Understand why separating suffix logic, base modification, and output formatting is essential.
- [] Test-driven development (TDD) basics: Write tests first, then code.
- [] Assertions: How to write expressive, meaningful tests.
- [] Abstraction: Avoid repeating logic by encapsulating behavior.
- [] Naming conventions: How good function names make code self-documenting.
- [] Pure functions: Keep helpers side-effect free for testability.
- [] Guard clauses: Simplify code by handling edge cases early.
- [] Delegation: Break big functions into smaller, focused units.
- [] Declarative programming: Define "what" should happen, not "how".
- [] Configuration over hardcoding: Keeps business logic flexible and scalable.
